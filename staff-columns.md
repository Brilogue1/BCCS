# Staff Assignment Columns - CONFIRMED

## Column Mappings
| Column | Header | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| AL | Assign Permit tech | Permit Tech |
| AM | Assign Plans Examiner | Plans Examiner |
| AN | Assign Inspector | Inspector |

## Checklist Columns (for task counting)
| Column | Header | Total Tasks |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| AC | Planning Checklist | 8 tasks |
| AD | PERMITTING INFORMATION | 10 tasks |
| AY | Inspections Checklist | 5 tasks |

## Task Counting Logic
- If checklist says "Send documents to client or permit tech" (step 6 of 8 in Planning), that person has completed 6 tasks and has 2 remaining
- Each staff member's workload is calculated based on their role assignments across all projects
